description: Styles Rails views with RoleModel's Optics design system — its components, `--op-` design tokens, and theme overrides. Use when writing or reviewing CSS, styling a view or component, picking a color, spacing, font, radius, or shadow value, fixing hard-coded CSS values, adding a project token, or theming an app (brand colors, fonts, color scales, dark mode).

# Optics

Optics is RoleModel's CSS design system, published as `@rolemodel/optics`. The installed package is the source of truth for which components and tokens exist. Read it instead of recalling names from memory, since tokens change between versions.

- Tokens: `node_modules/@rolemodel/optics/dist/tokens/tokens.json` (or the CSS under `dist/css/core/tokens/` in older versions)
- Components: `node_modules/@rolemodel/optics/dist/css/components/*.css`
- Version: the `@rolemodel/optics` entry in `package.json`
- Docs: https://docs.optics.rolemodel.design

## Before writing CSS

1. **Use an Optics component** if one fits. Check `dist/css/components/` for the block and its modifiers.
2. **Reuse a project class** if one exists. Search `app/assets/stylesheets/`.
3. **Write a new component** only when neither fits: one block per file in `app/assets/stylesheets/components/{block}.css`, named and nested per the `bem-structure` skill.

To change how an Optics component looks across the app, override it in `app/assets/stylesheets/components/overrides/{component}.css`. Don't fork it into a new block.

## Tokens, not literals

Every color, spacing, font, radius, border, and shadow value comes from a token.

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `#fff`, `rgb(...)`, `white` | `var(--op-color-background)`, `var(--op-color-primary-base)` |
| `padding: 12px` | `padding: var(--op-space-small)` |
| `border: 1px solid #ddd` | `border: var(--op-border-width) solid var(--op-color-border)` |
| `box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(...)` | `box-shadow: var(--op-shadow-small)` |

Put text on a colored surface with that surface's matching `on-` token: `--op-color-primary-on-base` on `--op-color-primary-base`, `--op-color-primary-on-plus-two` on `--op-color-primary-plus-two`.

When no token fits, define a project token with the app's own prefix (`--ya-color-brand-accent` for "Your App"). Never add new names under `--op-`.

## Gotchas

- **Malformed names fail silently.** `var(--op_color_primary_base)`, `var(--color-primary-base)`, and `var(--op-primary-color-base)` all resolve to nothing and the property falls back with no error. Check the name against `tokens.json`.
- **Plus and minus are luminosity, not emphasis.** `plus-*` is lighter and `minus-*` is darker; `plus-max` is the lightest step in the scale.
- **Optics has more components than you'd guess.** Besides `btn` and `card` it ships `avatar`, `badge`, `tag`, `alert`, `modal`, `table`, `tab`, `switch`, `spinner`, `sidebar`, `side-panel`, `text-pair`, `segmented-control`, and others. Look in `dist/css/components/` before writing any block, and don't hedge with "if your Optics version has it" when you can check. Writing your own block under an Optics name (a new `.avatar { … }`) doesn't create a separate component: it merges into Optics' rules and changes every avatar in the app. Use the Optics block, and put changes in `components/overrides/{component}.css` or a project modifier.
- **Partial theme overrides break the scale.** See [references/theming.md](references/theming.md) before changing any `--op-color-*` value.

## Theming

To change brand colors, fonts, radius, or a color scale for the whole app, read [references/theming.md](references/theming.md).
